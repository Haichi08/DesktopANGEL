■■Description
A Basic Virtual Pet featuring Ame from the game Needy Girl Overdose

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■■How to play
Click on the game icon to launch the game.

Ame will move around within the tab. So far, the only functions you can do is feed her some perfectly healthy medicine and let her sleep.

The game function is currently bugged, so happiness has instead been replaced with the settings button to not allow Ame to flatline.

Allowing any stat to reach zero can result in a Flatline. (Not implemented yet)
